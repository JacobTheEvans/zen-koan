          <p>Zen koan is a website to share koans. Koans are stories, dialogues, questions or statements in Zen to provoke "great doubt" and enlighten a Zen Student. The purpose to "solve" a koan is to exhaust the analytic intellect and will, preparing the mind to entertain an appropriate response on intuitive level.</p>
          <p>"These koans, or parables, were translated into English from a book called the Shaseki-shu (Collection of Stone and Sand), written late in the thirteenth century by the Japanese Zen teacher Muju (the "non-dweller"), and from anecdotes of Zen monks taken from various books published in Japan around the turn of the 20th century."â€”Ashidakim Zen Koans</p>
